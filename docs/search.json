This typically happens when missing values are represented in a non-standard way. For example, in these files, missing values are represented as \\N. Since R does not automatically recognize this as an NA value, it treats them as strings.\nTo address this, we need to:\n\nUse the mutate function to modify the columns.\nApply the as.numeric function to convert columns to the correct data type.\n\nWe can clean the datasets using the following code:\n\nNAME_BASICS &lt;- NAME_BASICS |&gt;\n    mutate_if(is.character, ~na_if(., \"\\\\N\")) |&gt;\n    mutate(birthYear = as.numeric(birthYear),\n           deathYear = as.numeric(deathYear))\n\n\nTITLE_BASICS &lt;- TITLE_BASICS |&gt;\n    mutate_if(is.character, ~na_if(., \"\\\\N\")) |&gt;\n    mutate(\n        startYear = as.numeric(startYear), \n        endYear = as.numeric(endYear),    \n        runtimeMinutes = as.numeric(runtimeMinutes)  \n    )\n\n\nTITLE_EPISODES &lt;- TITLE_EPISODES |&gt;\n    mutate_if(is.character, ~na_if(., \"\\\\N\")) |&gt;\n    mutate(\n        seasonNumber = as.numeric(seasonNumber),\n        episodeNumber = as.numeric(episodeNumber)\n    )\n\n\nTITLE_RATINGS &lt;- TITLE_RATINGS |&gt;\n    mutate_if(is.character, ~na_if(., \"\\\\N\")) |&gt;\n    mutate(\n        averageRating = as.numeric(averageRating), \n        numVotes = as.numeric(numVotes)  \n    )\n\n\nTITLE_CREW &lt;- TITLE_CREW |&gt;\n    mutate_if(is.character, ~na_if(., \"\\\\N\"))\n\n\nTITLE_PRINCIPALS &lt;- TITLE_PRINCIPALS |&gt;\n    mutate_if(is.character, ~na_if(., \"\\\\N\")) |&gt;\n    mutate(characters = str_replace_all(characters, '\\\\[|\\\\\"|\\\\]', '')) #clean undesired characters\n\nDuring the cleaning process, we transformed string columns into numeric columns and cleaned the character columns in the TITLE_PRINCIPALS table. Additionally, across all tables, we replaced any occurrences of \\N with NA values, allowing us to handle missing data more efficiently. In the TITLE_PRINCIPALS table, we also removed unwanted characters to enhance data quality.\nBy cleaning and preparing the data, we now have a clearer view of the relationships between tables and the variables at our disposal."

    "text": "Investigating “Jump the Shark” in Happy Days\nThe TV series Happy Days (1974-1984) gave us the common idiom “jump the shark.” The phrase refers to a moment in a controversial fifth season episode (aired in 1977) where a lead character literally jumped over a shark on water skis. Over time, this phrase has come to mean the point when a once-great show becomes ridiculous and begins to decline in quality.\nTo investigate this, we now ask: Is it true that episodes from the later seasons of Happy Days have lower average ratings than the early seasons? Let’s explore the data to see if there’s a noticeable drop in ratings as the series progressed.\n\ndata &lt;- TITLE_BASICS |&gt;\n  inner_join(TITLE_EPISODES, join_by(tconst == parentTconst)) |&gt;  # Join episodes with series\n  inner_join(TITLE_RATINGS, by = \"tconst\")  # Join ratings dat\n\nhappy_days &lt;- data |&gt;\n    filter(primaryTitle == \"Happy Days\") |&gt;\n    arrange(seasonNumber) |&gt;\n    select(primaryTitle, \"Season Number\" = seasonNumber, \"Average Rating\" = averageRating, year = endYear) |&gt;\n    distinct() |&gt;\n\n  gt() |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Happy Days Seasons & Ratings per season\"\n  )\n\nhappy_days\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHappy Days Seasons & Ratings per season\n\n\nprimaryTitle\nSeason Number\nAverage Rating\nyear\n\n\n\n\nHappy Days\n1\n7.4\n1984\n\n\nHappy Days\n2\n7.4\n1984\n\n\nHappy Days\n3\n7.4\n1984\n\n\nHappy Days\n4\n7.4\n1984\n\n\nHappy Days\n5\n7.4\n1984\n\n\nHappy Days\n6\n7.4\n1984\n\n\nHappy Days\n7\n7.4\n1984\n\n\nHappy Days\n8\n7.4\n1984\n\n\nHappy Days\n9\n7.4\n1984\n\n\nHappy Days\n10\n7.4\n1984\n\n\nHappy Days\n11\n7.4\n1984\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe assumption that the later seasons of Happy Days had lower average ratings is not true. As we can observe, the average rating remained constant at 7.4 across all seasons. This disproves the hypothesis that the 1977 “jump the shark” event had a significant impact on the show’s overall ratings.\nDespite the controversy surrounding that episode, the data shows no evidence of a decline in audience ratings afterward."

Based on our analysis, we determined that the threshold for a movie to be considered successful is an average rating of 7.9 or higher.\nThis threshold was derived from the analysis of the top 7 successful movies and the bottom 7 unsuccessful movies in terms of revenue. The score of 7.9 corresponds to the lowest rating of the most successful movies, specifically Avatar: The Way of Water.\nHowever, this threshold can be adjusted due to the limited number of successful movies.

Overall, there is a clear upward trend in the success of movies across all genres.

In contrast, the success ratios for Adventure and Action have shown growth since the 1970s, while the number of movies produced in these genres has remained steady.\nAdditionally, we observe that in the last decade, Thriller has increased both in the number of movies created and its success ratio, indicating a positive trend for this genre. Overall, there is a decline in movie productions, which can be attributed to the rise of streaming services that have transformed the way movies are produced and consumed. This trend is likely to continue as the industry adapts to new technologies and shifting consumer preferences."

    "text": "Proposal for Remake of North by Northwest\nWe propose a modern remake of Alfred Hitchcock’s 1959 classic North by Northwest, a thrilling action-adventure about mistaken identity and espionage. This project capitalizes on the growing popularity of the action, adventure, and thriller genres, all of which have seen strong growth over the past decade.\nChris Evans (success ratio 0.5, 12 films) will play the lead, Roger Thornhill. His global popularity from blockbuster franchises like Captain America guarantees mass appeal, particularly among younger audiences. Hugo Weaving (100% success ratio, 4 films) will play the sophisticated villain, bringing depth and menace, as he has done in The Matrix and The Lord of the Rings. Clark Gregg (100% success ratio, 4 films) will take on a pivotal supporting role, adding gravitas as a shadowy government figure.\nDavid Yates, with a 60% success ratio, is our chosen director. Known for delivering hits like Harry Potter and Fantastic Beasts, his ability to handle large-scale action-adventure films with complex narratives ensures this project will be a success.\nThe consistent rise of the action-adventure genre, paired with the recent resurgence of thrillers, positions North by Northwest perfectly for a remake. Our analysis shows that these genres have seen significant growth, and tapping into this trend with a strong cast and proven director will maximize our movie’s potential.\nWe project the film to gross $600 to $800 million globally, appealing to both classic film fans and modern action audiences."

On the other hand, the states that lost the most seats are New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, and Michigan. The following table explains the population growth between 1976 to 2022 shifts are the main reason for these changes.\n\n\n\nLocation\nGrowth Percentage\n\n\n\n\nArizona\n192.0%\n\n\nFlorida\n161.9%\n\n\nTexas\n145.9%\n\n\nGeorgia\n125.0%\n\n\nCalifornia\n77.3%\n\n\nUSA\n52.8%\n\n\nIllinois\n12.5%\n\n\nPennsylvania\n10.2%\n\n\nNew York\n10.1%\n\n\nOhio\n9.3%\n\n\nMichigan\n8.1%\n\n\n\nWe see clearly that the Usa is in the middle of the list, and the states that lost the most seats are in the bottom of the list.\n\n\nShow the code\n# Filter for New York State and relevant House races\nny_house_data &lt;- DATA_HOUSE |&gt;\n  filter(state == \"NEW YORK\", office == \"US HOUSE\")\n\n# Calculate total votes (with fusion) and major party votes (without fusion)\nfusion_analysis &lt;- ny_house_data |&gt;\n  mutate(is_major_party = party %in% c(\"DEMOCRAT\", \"REPUBLICAN\")) |&gt;\n  group_by(year, district, candidate) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    total_votes_all_lines = sum(candidatevotes, na.rm = TRUE),\n    major_party_votes = sum(candidatevotes[is_major_party], na.rm = TRUE),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )\n\n# Determine winners by both fusion and non-fusion scenarios\nwinners_fusion &lt;- fusion_analysis |&gt;\n  group_by(year, district) |&gt;\n  filter(total_votes_all_lines == max(total_votes_all_lines)) |&gt;\n  select(year, district, candidate, total_votes_all_lines) |&gt;\n  rename(fusion_winner = candidate, fusion_votes = total_votes_all_lines)|&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\nwinners_nonfusion &lt;- fusion_analysis |&gt;\n  group_by(year, district) |&gt;\n  filter(major_party_votes == max(major_party_votes)) |&gt;\n  select(year, district, candidate, major_party_votes) |&gt;\n  rename(nonfusion_winner = candidate, nonfusion_votes = major_party_votes) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\n# Find elections where fusion changed the winner\nelection_outcomes &lt;- winners_fusion |&gt;\n  inner_join(winners_nonfusion, by = c(\"year\", \"district\")) |&gt;\n  filter(fusion_winner != nonfusion_winner) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(year))\n  \n\ndatatable(\n  election_outcomes,\n  options = list(\n    pageLength = 10,         # Rows per page\n    autoWidth = TRUE,        # Adjust columns automatically\n    dom = 'tip',             # Only show table, info, and pagination\n    lengthMenu = c(5, 10, 15, 20)  # Options for rows per page\n  ),\n  rownames = FALSE           # Hide row names\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see, fusion voting can be a deciding factor in elections. The table demonstrates that fusion voting increases the likelihood of being elected by enabling candidates to gather votes from multiple party lines. This consolidates support in a way that would not be possible without fusion, giving fusion candidates a strategic advantage.\n\n\nAnalyzing Presidential vs. Congressional Vote Patterns Across Parties\nThis analysis explores whether presidential candidates tend to run ahead of or behind their congressional counterparts in the same state. Specifically, we’re investigating if Democratic and Republican presidential candidates receive more votes in a given state than all congressional candidates from their party in that same state.\nThe following code will compare these vote counts, identifying instances where presidential candidates either outperformed (“ahead”) or underperformed (“behind”) their co-partisans. This will also help us understand if this trend varies over time, across states, or between parties, providing insights into the relative popularity of presidential candidates within each party.\n\n\nShow the code\n# Aggregate Democratic and Republican presidential votes by state and year\npresidential_votes &lt;- DATA_PRESIDENT |&gt;\n  filter(office == \"US PRESIDENT\", party_simplified %in% c(\"DEMOCRAT\", \"REPUBLICAN\")) |&gt;\n  group_by(year, state, party_simplified) |&gt;\n  summarise(total_pres_votes = sum(candidatevotes, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n# Aggregate Democratic and Republican congressional votes by state and year\ncongressional_votes &lt;- DATA_HOUSE |&gt;\n  filter(office == \"US HOUSE\", party %in% c(\"DEMOCRAT\", \"REPUBLICAN\")) |&gt;\n  group_by(year, state, party) |&gt;\n  summarise(total_congress_votes = sum(candidatevotes, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  rename(party_simplified = party)\n\n# Merge the presidential and congressional vote data\nvote_comparison &lt;- presidential_votes |&gt;\n  inner_join(congressional_votes, by = c(\"year\", \"state\", \"party_simplified\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    vote_difference = total_pres_votes - total_congress_votes,\n    ran_ahead = ifelse(vote_difference &gt; 0, \"Ahead\", \"Behind\")\n  )\n\n# Additional Visualization: Calculate the average vote difference per year across all states\navg_vote_diff &lt;- vote_comparison |&gt;\n  group_by(year, party_simplified) |&gt;\n  summarise(avg_vote_difference = mean(vote_difference, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n# Line chart for average vote difference over time\nggplot(avg_vote_diff, aes(x = year, y = avg_vote_difference, color = party_simplified)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.2) +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Average Vote Difference Between Presidential and Congressional Candidates\",\n    subtitle = \"Across All States, by Party (1976 - 2020)\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Average Vote Difference (Presidential - Congressional)\",\n    color = \"Party\"\n  ) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"DEMOCRAT\" = \"blue\", \"REPUBLICAN\" = \"red\")) +\n\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see in the image, the average vote difference between presidential and congressional candidates has fluctuated over the years. On this, we can see a major fluctuation in the Republican party, what indicate that the presidential candidate has a major influence on votes than the congressional candidates. For Democrats, the difference is not that big, but still, the presidential candidate has a major influence on votes than the congressional candidates.\n\n\nShow the code\n# Summary of total instances where presidential candidates ran ahead or behind, grouped by party\nparty_summary_stats &lt;- vote_comparison |&gt;\n  group_by(party_simplified) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    total_ahead = sum(ran_ahead == \"Ahead\"),\n    total_behind = sum(ran_ahead == \"Behind\"),\n    Difference = total_ahead - total_behind,  # Calculate the variance between ahead and behind\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )\n\n# Display the summary table\nparty_summary_stats |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Summary of Presidential Candidates Running Ahead or Behind Congressional Candidates\",\n    subtitle = \"Total Instances by Party (1976-2020)\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    party_simplified = \"Party\",\n    total_ahead = \"Total States (Ahead)\",\n    total_behind = \"Total States (Behind)\",\n    Difference = \"Difference (Ahead - Behind)\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of Presidential Candidates Running Ahead or Behind Congressional Candidates\n\n\nTotal Instances by Party (1976-2020)\n\n\nParty\nTotal States (Ahead)\nTotal States (Behind)\nDifference (Ahead - Behind)\n\n\n\n\nDEMOCRAT\n318\n274\n44\n\n\nREPUBLICAN\n390\n207\n183\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we can observe the difference between the number of states where the presidential candidate ran ahead or behind their congressional counterparts. The table shows that both Democratic and Republican presidential candidates have run ahead more than behind, however, Republicans have a higher difference between the two categories. This indicates that Republican presidential candidates tend to outperform their congressional counterparts more frequently than Democratic candidates.\n\n\nImporting and Plotting Shapefile Data\nThe shapefiles we downloaded are provided in zip archives containing several files, but we only need the .shp file from each archive. In this section, we’ll walk through extracting the .shp file, loading it into R, and creating a plot from the data. The main tool we’ll use is the sf package, specifically the read_sf() function, which allows us to read shapefiles directly into R. Below, I’ll demonstrate how this process works.\n\n\nShow the code\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(sf)\n\nif(!file.exists(\"nyc_borough_boundaries.zip\")){\n    download.file(\"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/geospatial/tqmj-j8zm?method=export&format=Shapefile\", \n              destfile=\"nyc_borough_boundaries.zip\")\n}\n\n##-\ntd &lt;- tempdir(); \nzip_contents &lt;- unzip(\"nyc_borough_boundaries.zip\", \n                      exdir = td)\n    \nfname_shp &lt;- zip_contents[grepl(\"shp$\", zip_contents)]\nnyc_sf &lt;- read_sf(fname_shp)\n\n\nWith the following code, we can plot the shapefile data to visualize the boundaries of New York City boroughs.\n\n\nShow the code\nread_shp_from_zip &lt;- function(zip_file) {\n  files_in_zip &lt;- unzip(zip_file, list = TRUE)\n  \n  shp_file &lt;- files_in_zip$Name[grepl(\"\\\\.shp$\", files_in_zip$Name)]\n  \n  if (length(shp_file) == 1) {\n    unzip(zip_file, files = shp_file, exdir = tempdir())\n    \n    shp_path &lt;- file.path(tempdir(), shp_file)\n    \n    shape_data &lt;- read_sf(shp_path)\n    \n    return(shape_data)\n  } else {\n    message(\"No .shp file found in the provided zip archive.\")\n    return(NULL)\n  }\n}\n\n\nNow we would plot the shapefile data to visualize the boundaries of New York City boroughs.\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(nyc_sf, \n       aes(geometry=geometry)) + \n    geom_sf()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso we can plot the shapefile data with a fill color to visualize the boundaries of New York City boroughs.\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(nyc_sf, \n       aes(geometry=geometry, \n           fill = shape_area)) + \n    geom_sf()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectoral College Results in 2000\nIn this section, we will create a choropleth map to visualize the results of the 2000 U.S. Presidential Election.

    "text": "Objectives\nThe primary goal of this project is to equip new CUNY faculty with an evidence-based recommendation for selecting the optimal retirement plan (TRS or ORP). This involves analyzing historical economic and financial data to assess how each plan performs under different economic conditions. We will utilize the following datasets:\n\nRate of Inflation: Inflation erodes the purchasing power of retirement benefits. For TRS, it determines the annual adjustment in benefits, while for ORP, it impacts the real value of savings and withdrawals.\nRate of Wage Growth: Wage growth directly influences contributions to both plans. For TRS, it affects the final average salary (FAS), which determines retirement payouts. For ORP, higher wages lead to larger investment contributions.\nUS Equity Market Returns: Equity market performance is crucial for ORP participants, as their investments grow with market returns. US equities represent a significant portion of most retirement portfolios.\nInternational Equity Market Returns: Diversification through international equities reduces risk and enhances returns for ORP participants. It provides a broader perspective on investment performance beyond the US market.\nBond Returns: Bonds are a critical component of retirement portfolios, especially for ORP participants as they approach retirement. Bonds provide stability and reduce volatility in investment returns.\nShort-Term Debt Returns: Short-term debt, such as Treasury yields, represents a safe investment option with lower risk. It is particularly relevant for retirees seeking liquidity and capital preservation.\n\nBy combining insights from these datasets, we will simulate potential retirement outcomes for each plan, identify risks such as running out of funds, and quantify the financial benefits of each option. This comprehensive approach ensures that our recommendation aligns with the diverse financial priorities of faculty members.\n\nLibraries\nThe following are the libraries we would use throughtout the project.\n\n\nShow the code\nlibrary(httr2)    # For API requests\nlibrary(dplyr)    # For data manipulation\nlibrary(ggplot2)  # For visualization\nlibrary(zoo)      # For handling time-series data and filling missing values\nlibrary(DT)\nlibrary(ggcorrplot)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(plotly)"

    "section": "Key Findings:",
    "text": "Key Findings:\n\n1. Inflation Rate and Wage Growth:\n\nCorrelation: 0.98 (Very strong)\nInterpretation: When inflation increases, wage growth tends to follow suit. This suggests that as the cost of living rises, your wages are likely to increase as well, which helps you keep up with inflation.\n\n\n\n2. Stock Market Returns:\n\nUS and International Markets:\n\nCorrelation: 0.97 (Very strong)\nInterpretation: US and international stock markets have a highly positive correlation, meaning they often move in the same direction. This makes diversification between US and international markets a good strategy for reducing risk while maintaining growth potential.\n\n\n\nUS Equity Returns and Bond Yields:\n\nCorrelation: 0.68 (Moderate)\nInterpretation: The moderate correlation suggests that when US stocks perform well, bond yields may not follow the same trend. Investors need to balance their portfolios between stocks and bonds, taking into account their risk tolerance and time horizon.\n\n\n\n\n3. Inflation and Other Variables:\n\nInflation and US Stock Returns:\n\nCorrelation: 0.92 (Strong)\nInterpretation: Inflation and US stock returns are highly correlated. As inflation rises, US stocks tend to perform well, making stocks a potential hedge against inflation.\n\n\n\nInflation and International Stock Returns:\n\nCorrelation: 0.97 (Very strong)\nInterpretation: Like US stocks, international stocks also tend to rise with inflation, making global diversification a viable strategy for mitigating inflation risk.\n\n\n\nInflation and Bond Yields:\n\nCorrelation: 0.72 (Moderate)\nInterpretation: Inflation and bond yields are moderately correlated. Rising inflation generally leads to higher bond yields, which can help protect fixed-income investments from losing purchasing power.\n\n\n\n\n4. Bond Yield and Short-Term Yield:\n\nCorrelation: 0.75 (Strong)\nInterpretation: Bond yields and short-term yields tend to move in the same direction, which suggests that both types of bonds respond similarly to changes in interest rates."

Starting Salary\n\nThe employee’s starting salary is $50,000 in January 2009 and is retired in November 2024. Years served = 15 years.\nThe salary increases annually based on historical wage growth data.\n\n\n\n2. TRS Benefit Calculation\n\nFinal Average Salary (FAS):\n\nCalculated as the average of the last three years of salary, adjusted for wage growth.\n\nYears of Service:\n\nThe employee works for 15 years (from 2009 to 2024), and their pension benefit is calculated based on 15 years of service.\n\nMonthly Pension:\n\nThe pension benefit is calculated as ( () ) (since the employee works 15 years).\n\nInflation Adjustment:\n\nThe pension benefit will be inflation-adjusted annually based on the CPI. The adjustment will be between 1% and 3% per year, applied each September after retirement.\n\n\n\n\n3. ORP Benefit Calculation\n\nMonthly Contributions:\n\nThe employee and employer contributions are calculated based on the salary brackets (e.g., 3% for salaries ≤$45,000).\nContributions are made monthly throughout the employee’s 15-year career.\n\nInvestment Growth:\n\nThe employee’s contributions grow using the average market returns over time:\n\nUS equities: 7%, International equities: 6%, Bonds: 4%.\n\n\nRetirement Withdrawal:\n\nThe employee can begin withdrawing funds from their ORP account upon retirement.\nA general rule of thumb is to withdraw 4% annually from the accumulated balance at retirement.\n\n\n\nThe following code snippets will calculate the retirement benefits for both TRS and ORP based on the assumptions outlined above.

This can serve as a crucial factor for decision-making in retirement planning."

Key insights from the visualization are as follows:\n\nMonthly OPR Benefit:\n\nThe monthly benefit derived from the OPR system is $883.35, as shown by the first bar.\nThis represents a smaller portion compared to the TRS benefit, reflecting the structure of OPR benefit allocations.\n\nMonthly TRS Benefit:\n\nThe monthly benefit derived from the TRS system is $1769.43, as shown by the taller second bar.\nThis indicates a significantly higher payout, suggesting that the TRS system may provide a more robust financial benefit for retirees compared to the OPR system.\n\nComparison:\n\nThe TRS benefit is nearly double the OPR benefit, highlighting a substantial disparity between the two systems in terms of monthly payouts.\n\n\nThis comparison provides valuable insight into the financial implications of selecting between the OPR and TRS systems, with the TRS system offering higher monthly benefits. This can serve as a crucial factor for decision-making in retirement planning."
